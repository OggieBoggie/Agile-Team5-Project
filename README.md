# GymConnects
Project for agile group 5

## Setup
If you cloned this git repository to your device, make sure to move `userDatabase.json` outside of this directory. For example, if the folder you are in is `Parent-Directory/Agile-Team5-Project`, you want to move the `userDatabase.json` into `Parent-Directory/userDatabase.json`.

## Extra Notes
Once you have done that, run `npm start` to run the application.

It will direct you to the link [http://localhost:3000/home].

You should register a user so you can log in.
